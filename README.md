# letter-tracker

Designed to accept a string of letters and display them in a list.

You can use the listed letters in the pool to create new strings. As the letters are used, they are removed from the list. If letters in the new string are deleted, they are placed back in the list in their original position.

It's pretty crude, but it works!
