# letter-tracker

Not sure how to succinctly describe what this does :)

Essentially, the user can provide a chunk of text as an initial input. This chunk is added to a visible dicitionary of letters.
From there, you can type text into a second field and see which letters are used from the visible dictionary.

It's pretty crude, but it works! I also set the app up to place letters back into their original locals if they are deleted from the second input field. That's probably what I'm most proud of with this project.
